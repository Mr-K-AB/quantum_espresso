Download the NBO v7 from the download link. Use the purchase code for downloading.

Copy the tar file downloaded to a desired directory from where we run the software.

Unzip the tar file.

inside, the `gennbo` is the executable of the software.

# 2. RUNNING

*.47 type file are the input files for this executable and *.nbo are the output files.

eg: 
we have `<file_name_withno_47>.47` as one input file in our directory,
```
./gennbo <file_name_withno_47>
```
this will create a `<file_name_withno_47>.nbo ` file as the output for this process, in the same directory.
