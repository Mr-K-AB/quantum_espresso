Gaussian-16 C.01/NBO7 Installation Guide
----------------------------------------

These instructions describe the installation of NBO7 with Gaussian-16
Revision C.01.  These instructions assume that Gaussian (G16) is
already installed and tested on your platform.

The installation of NBO7 can be completed as follows:

1.  Install NBO7 as described in the README file in the top-level nbo7
    directory.

    If installing NBO7 from source, build the executables using the
    same integer length (i4 for 32-bit integers, i8 for 64-bit) as is
    used by G16 (most likely i8).  If it's not clear which integer
    length G16 uses, it is safe to build both the i4 and i8
    executables, then determine the integer length later.

2.  Edit the gaunbo7 script in nbo7/bin.  Set the variables GAUNBO,
    BINDIR, INT, and NBOMEM for your environment.  For example, if
    NBO7 is installed in /opt, G16 uses 64-bit integers, and the
    g16nbo executable should allocate 50 MB of memory, set

       setenv GAUNBO g16nbo
       setenv BINDIR /opt/nbo7/bin
       setenv INT i8
       setenv NBOMEM 50mb

    See notes below regarding memory allocation with NBO7.

    Also see notes in the gaunbo7 script on the environment variables
    OMP_NUM_THREADS and OMP_STACKSIZE and limits on stacksize if you
    intend to run parallel NRT.

    gaunbo7 is a tcsh shell script.  Ensure that tcsh is available for
    your operating system (type 'which tcsh'), and if not available,
    install it.

3.  Ensure that the path to gaunbo7 is included in the path
    environment variable.  This is perhaps best done in the script
    used to execute G16 calculations.

       set path = ( /opt/nbo7/bin $path )

    Alternatively, simply copy the gaunbo7 script into the
    $g16root/g16 directory of your G16 installation.

    Consider repeating steps 2 and 3 for the gaunbo6 script, a copy of
    which is also in nbo7/bin.  gaunbo6 allows users to execute NBO7
    using the old 'nbo6' Gaussian input options, as described below.

4.  Perform test calculations.  Examples are given in the
    nbo7/tests/gaussian/g16-c01 directory.

NBO7 tests integer communications to ensure that G16 and NBO7 are
using the same integer lengths.  If NBO7 fails, try switching the
integer length (i.e. from i8 or i4, or vice versa).

-------------------------------------
Requesting NBO7 analysis in G16 Input
-------------------------------------

Users request NBO7 analysis using Gaussian keywords of the following
forms:

    pop=nbo7             -- default NBO7 analysis, no $NBO input
    pop=nbo7read         -- NBO7 analysis with $NBO input
    pop=nbo7del          -- NBO7 analysis with deletions
    pop=(nbo7,savenbos)  -- default NBO7 analysis, save NBOs,
       sorted by energy, on the checkpoint file
    pop=(nbo7,savenlmos) -- default NBO7 analysis, save NLMOs on
       the checkpoint file

Note that these keywords are analogous to the pop=nbo, pop=nboread,
etc. keywords that are used to run the old NBO 3.1 analysis (Link
607) of G16.

Users may also request NBO7 analysis using the older (deprecated)
'nbo6' keyword options (e.g. pop=nbo6, pop=nbo6read, etc.).  'nbo6'
causes Gaussian to execute the gaunbo6 script, which performs NBO7
analysis like gaunbo7.

----------------------------------
Gaussian-16 C.01/NBO7 Connectivity
----------------------------------

Although most users may be generally (and safely) unaware of the
details of G16/NBO7 connectivity, we provide a brief description of
the G16/NBO7 interaction because it differs from that of earlier
versions of the G16 and NBO programs.  Three files play key roles for
NBO7 analysis with G16.  These include:

   * gaunbo7       -- utility script for executing NBO7
   * g16nbo.i8.exe -- G16/NBO7 interface program (or g16nbo.i4.exe)
   * nbo7.i8.exe   -- NBO7 program (or nbo7.i4.exe)

Each of these files is located in the nbo7/bin directory of the NBO7
distribution.

NBO7 interacts with Gaussian through G16's external program interface
(Link 612).  L612 writes formatted checkpoint and unformatted matrix
element files that include information (density matrix, overlap
matrix, basis function details, etc.) that are relevant to NBO
analysis.  L612 then attempts to execute the script gaunbo7, which in
turn initiates NBO7.  If L612 is unable to locate gaunbo7 (i.e. the
script is not in the user's path), L612 will fail and G16 will proceed
without reporting NBO analysis.

gaunbo7 identifies the g16nbo and nbo7 executables and initiates
g16nbo.  g16nbo is a utility program that parses the checkpoint and
matrix element files provided by L612.  Information is subsuquently
passed from g16nbo to the nbo7 executable for analysis.  NBO7 output
is written to the output file for the G16 calculation.

---------------------------
Memory Allocation with NBO7
---------------------------

As described above, two executables (g16nbo and nbo7) work in tandem to
perform NBO7 analysis.  g16nbo is the host program that parses
information from Gaussian's checkpoint and matrix elements files and
sends this information to the nbo7 client program.  The two programs manage
memory separately.

The 32-bit executables use a fixed amount of memory (100 Mwords for
g16nbo.i4.exe and 1 GB for nbo7.i4.exe).  These amounts can only be
increased if you have the source distribution of NBO7 and edit the
maxmem.fh parameter files in nbo7/src/g16nbo/include and
nbo7/src/nbo/include.

The 64-bit executables use dynamic memory allocation.  By default,
g16nbo.i8.exe allocates 100 Mwords and nbo7.i8.exe allocates 1 GB.
These amounts can be changed using the NBOMEM environment variable for
the g16nbo interface (see the gaunbo7 script) or the MEMORY keyword of
the $NBO keylist (see the NBO7 Manual) for the nbo7 program.

Troubleshooting G16/NBO7
------------------------

See the notes in the gaunbo7 script for guidance when problems are
encountered getting G16 to work with NBO7.
