------------------------------------------
1.  Unpacking the NBO7 binary distribution
------------------------------------------

The NBO7 binary distribution is delivered as a gzip-compressed tar
file.  Copy this file to the directory in which you intend to install
NBO7.  For example, if you copy the tar file to the /opt directory,
unpacking the distribution will install NBO7 in the /opt/nbo7
subdirectory.

Unpack the distribution using tar, e.g.,

   cp nbo7.0-bin-linux-x64.tar.gz /opt
   cd /opt
   tar -zxvf nbo7.0-bin-linux-x64.tar.gz

For MacOS users, running NBO7 likely requires that you also install
Xcode from the Apple App Store, and perhaps the gfortran compiler (see
https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).

Ensure that the tcsh shell is installed on your operating system.
Most of the scripts provided in the NBO7 distribution are written for
tcsh.

------------------------------------------
3.  Performing a sample GenNBO calculation
------------------------------------------

Perform a sample NBO7 calculation using the standalone GenNBO program.

   cd /path/to/nbo7        ! Change to the top-level directory
   gennbo ch3nh2

Input is read from ch3nh2.47, and output is written to ch3nh2.nbo.
The output of this sample calculation is described in detail in
Section A.3 of the NBO 7.0 Manual.

'gennbo' is a tcsh script with the following usage:

   Usage: gennbo <jobname> [threads] [stack] [detail]

    jobname: name of GenNBO input file (required; no .47 extension)
    threads: number of multi-processing threads (optional; default=1)
      stack: stack size for threads (optional; default=256M)
     detail: detailed NBO output (optional; "verbose" if desired)

By default, GenNBO runs as a single process (thread) with no detailed
NBO output.  'threads' specifies the number of threads to be used for
parallel NRT analysis, and 'stack' is the stacksize per thread.  NRT
is the only parallelized module in NBO7.

If you intend to use the gennbo script to perform GenNBO calculations
in directories other than the root nbo7 directory of the distribution,
edit the gennbo script, setting the environment variable NBOBIN to the
path for the NBO executables.  For example, if NBO7 is installed in
/opt/nbo7, set NBOBIN as follows:

   setenv NBOBIN /opt/nbo7/bin

-------------------------------------------
4.  Performing additional test calculations
-------------------------------------------

The nbo7/tests/gennbo directory contains sample GenNBO input (.47) and
output (.arc) corresponding to the examples described in the NBO 7.0
Manual.  You can run these calculations individually, e.g.,

   cd /path/to/nbo7/tests/gennbo
   gennbo a.3

--------------------------
5.  Troubleshooting GenNBO
--------------------------

If GenNBO fails to run for you, try the following:

   cd /path/to/nbo
   gennbo ch3nh2 null null verbose

Verbose output will be written to ch3nh2.nbo.  This output may help
you identify the cause of the failure.  If not, forward the output to
Eric Glendening (glendening@indstate.edu) for assistance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Installing NBO7 in Gaussian, GAMESS, Molpro, Orca, and Q-Chem
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure that calculations with GenNBO run without failing, as described
above, before attempting to install NBO7 with these programs.  If
GenNBO fails, NBO7 will likely fail for every other installation.

Instructions for installing NBO7 with various electronic structure
program are provided in the nbo7/install directory.

Limitations of the NBO binaries resulting from fixed dimension
statements are listed in CONTENTS in nbo7/bin.
