The executables and libraries are compiled using the following
Fortran and C compilers:

   gfortran/gcc 5.5.0 -- nbo7.0-bin-linux-x64.tar.gz
   gfortran/gcc 5.5.0 -- nbo7.0-bin-osx-x64.tar.gz

See instructions in the nbo7/install subdirectory for information
regarding the installation of NBO7 into various electronic structure
systems.

The following limits are set for the executables of the binary
distribution:
                    maximum number of atoms =  999
          maximum number of basis functions = 9999
    maximum number of basis function shells = 2000
 maximum number of basis function exponents = 5000

Users seeking to reconfigure these limits are encouraged to obtain the
NBO7 source distribution.  Contact tcinbo@chem.wisc.edu.

GenNBO and the G09/G16 interface programs are respectively configured
with 50 Mwords and 100 Mwords of scratch memory.  These limits are
fixed for 32-bit (i4) integer programs but can be dynamically changed
for the 64-bit (i8) programs.  For the latter, see the NBOMEM
environment variable for the interface programs (GenNBO, G09NBO, and
G16NBO) and the MEMORY keyword of the $NBO keylist for the NBO7
program.
