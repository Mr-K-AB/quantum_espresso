#  [Having problems getting NBO to run with Gaussian?  See below.]

#  Use this script (gaunbo7) to perform NBO7 analysis with G16 C.01 or
#  later.  Use the companion script (gaunbo6) for G09 D.01/E.01 and
#  for G16 A.03/B.01.

#  Ensure that the directory containing this script is present in the
#  user's path during the Gaussian calculation.  Alternatively, it
#  generally works well to simply copy this file to $g16root/g16, and
#  edit it as described below.

#  Inspect and set, as appropriate, the following four environment
#  variables.



#  Select Gaussian interface (g16nbo only):

setenv GAUNBO g16nbo












#  Specify NBO7 executable directory:

# *********************************************************************************************************************************
# Absolute path hard coded
setenv BINDIR $HOME/copied/MIS_AB/Packages/NBO/nbo7/bin
# *********************************************************************************************************************************

















#  Set 64-bit (i8) or 32-bit (i4) integer representation (likely the
#  former):

setenv INT i8

#  Optionally, for 64-bit integers only, set the amount of dynamically
#  allocatable memory available to the Gaussian interface program.
#  Memory is specified as an integer number of megawords (mw),
#  megabytes (mb), or gigabytes (gb).

#  Examples:

#  setenv NBOMEM 50mw
#  setenv NBOMEM 512mb
#  setenv NBOMEM 1gb

setenv NBOMEM 100mw


#  The interface uses 100mw of memory if NBOMEM is not specified here.
#  The interface ignores the NBOMEM environment variable for 32-bit
#  integers and uses a fixed 100mw of memory.

#  Note that the NBOMEM environment variable does not impact the
#  amount of dynamically allocatable memory available to the NBO7
#  client program.  Instead, memory in NBO7 is set by the MEMORY
#  keyword of the $NBO keylist (see the NBO7 Manual).

#  -------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Environment variables for parallel NRT:

#  Optionally set the number of threads to be used for parallel NRT
#  calculations.  Note that it is probably more approriate to set this
#  environment variable in the script that you use to submit your
#  Gaussian calculations.

#  setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 8

#  Optionally set the stacksize for the threads for parallel NRT
#  calculations.  The stacksize can be specified in bytes (B),
#  kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), or gigabtypes (B).  256MB per thread
#  is usually sufficient.

#  Examples:

#  setenv OMP_STACKSIZE 268435456B
#  setenv OMP_STACKSIZE 262144K
setenv OMP_STACKSIZE 256M
#  setenv OMP_STACKSIZE 1G

#  Finally, the default stack size for the Linux or Mac operating
#  systems may be too small for large calculations.  If your
#  calculation fails with no warning, the problem may be that there is
#  insufficient memory allocated to the stack.

#  The following command shows, for the tcsh shell, how to set the
#  maximum stack size to 128mb.  Note that the units for the limit
#  command are in kb.

#  limit stacksize 262144

#  You can alternatively allow the stack to have unlimited size.

limit stacksize unlimited

#  -------------------------------------------------------------------

#  If you are having problems getting NBO to execute with Gaussian, try
#  the following:

#  1.  Ensure that this script has execute permission.  If not, set
#      the permission using 'chmod +x gaunbo6'.

#  2.  Change the first line of this script to read '#!/bin/tcsh -fx'.
#      Adding the "x" flag forces tcsh to echo each command in this
#      script as the command is executed.  Are these commands echoed
#      in your Gaussian output file?  If not Gaussian probably cannot
#      find this script in your path.

#  3.  Uncomment the following line, enabling verbose printing by the
#      NBO program to the Gaussian output file.  If verbose printing
#      does not begin by indicating that the Gaussian/NBO interface is
#      starting, this script probably does not correctly identify the
#      path to the NBO executable directory (NBOBIN).

#  setenv NBODTL verbose

#  -------------------------------------------------------------------

#  The remainder of this script can be safely ignored.

#  Set environment variables for files that transfer data between
#  Gaussian and NBO7:

@ narg = 0
@ nfinp = 2 + $narg
@ nfmsg = 4 + $narg
@ nfchk = 5 + $narg
@ nmat = 6 + $narg
setenv inpfile  $argv[$nfinp]
setenv fchkfile $argv[$nfchk]
setenv matfile  $argv[$nmat]
set tmp = $argv[$nfchk]
set tmp = "$tmp:r"

#  Specify the NBO7 executable, and set the default filename:

setenv NBOEXE $BINDIR/nbo7.$INT.exe
setenv NBOFIL $tmp

#  Execute the Gaussian/NBO7 interface:

unlimit core
$BINDIR/$GAUNBO.$INT.exe
