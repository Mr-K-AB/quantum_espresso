NBO output from Molpro 2018.3 is given in the accompanying .arc files.

Default NPA (only) and NBO analyses can be requested in Molpro input
using the

    npa6;
    nbo6;

directives.  Note that these '6' directives work equally well for NBO6
(now obsolete) and NBO7.

Use the 'density' option to select the desired density (other than the
default) for analysis,

    {nbo6;density,2150.2,state=1.1;}

and the 'save' option to return orbital sets (e.g. NBOs, NLMOs) to
Molpro

    {nbo6;save,nbo,2101.2;}
