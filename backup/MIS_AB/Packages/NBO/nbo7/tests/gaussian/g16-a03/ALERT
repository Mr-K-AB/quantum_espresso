Alert -- for G16 A.03 only.

NBO deletions (pop=nbo6del) fail with G16 A.03 unless you use a
non-standard route.  This is fixed in G16 post-A.03.  See
nbo7/tests/gaussian/g16-a03/DELETIONS for instructions for preparing
non-standard routes for deletions with G16 A.03.  Sample non-standard
routes are also shown in am1.com, ch3.com, ch3nh2.com, and tutdel.com.
