NBO output from G16 Rev. A.03 is given in the accompanying .arc file.

Users request NBO7 analysis using the 'nbo6' options of Gaussian's pop
keyword (e.g. pop=npa6, nbo6, nbo6del, etc.)

Keylist input for pop=nbo6read and pop=nbo6del can be distributed
across multiple lines of the Gaussian input file.  NBO input is
terminated by a blank line.  Thus, keylist input may appear as
follows:

   $nbo  steric  $end
   $del
     delete 1 element 3 11
   $end
   <blank line>

Note that a blank line should not be used to separate the different
keylists ($nbo and $del, in this example).  Inserting a blank line in
the input before the $del keylist would result in Gaussian only
forwarding the $nbo input to NBO7, neglecting the $del input and
preventing the program from performing deletions analysis.
